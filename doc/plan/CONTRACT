## Team Contract 

- We all promise to listen to each other’s ideas with respect.
- We all promise to do our work as best as we can.
- We all promise to do our work on time.
- We all promise to ask for help if we need it.
- Communication - We all promise to reach out to our teammates on a daily basis. 
- Work quality - We all promise to produce the best work we can.
- Individual accountability - We all promise to follow the individual expectations of this course.

If someone on our team breaks one or more of our rules, the team may have a meeting and ask the person to follow our agreement. If the person still breaks the rules, we will ask our teacher to help find a solution.
