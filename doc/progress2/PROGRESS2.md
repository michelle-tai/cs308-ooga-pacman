###run the program 
1. Starting
2. moving around
3. dark mode and light mode
###data files 
nothing yet; still working on it
####JUnit or TestFX tests 
still working on it


### describe how their work relates to specific demoed features as they are shown
* Hannah: all ui stuff, very cool and nice! also some map creation
* Olga: still working on backend collisions, set up class/object that holds map object (with hannah)
* Michelle: movement, ghost and pacman movement/movement class
* Caleb: data

### learned during this Sprint 
* controller is probably best instead of having backend object in the frontend objects

###and the implementation plan for the next Sprint
* work on collision checking
* make tests
* make sure error checking in place
* controller
* life and score updates
* connecting all with data files/configs


###describe how much of the planned features were completed this Sprint and what helped or impeded progress
Original Sprint plan, with things completed bolded: 
* **Basic interface working of the maze of pacman and a pacman moving around** with the collisions for the two working
* **be able to read maze configuration from data file**
* Main character and block collision 
* **Basic movement controls**
* _Configuration for maze_ (kinda)
* **Creation of sprites and coins, not necessarily integrated yet**

Takeaways:
* We were able to complete most of our goals for this sprint
* Things that helped were calls to catch up on things, communicating through groupme, splitting 
tasks up
* Things that impeded were being pretty busy, not being on the same page about deadlines, life lol

###describe a specific significant event that occurred this Sprint and what was learned from it
* michelle's restructuring of packages kinda messed things up–i need to communicate more abotu what's going on
* confusion about deadlines–communicate more
* just overall need to communicate more?

###describe what worked, what did not, and something specific that is planned for improvement next Sprint
What worked: 
* splitting tasks up
* having some calls to regroup

What did not: 
* not communicating enough

Something planned: 
* more communication 
* more time we can dedicate to this project

###what features are planned to be completed during the next Sprint (taking into account what was done this Sprint), who will work on each feature, and any concerns that may complicate the plan
* Collisions for all sprites - olga, michelle
* maybe different behaviors for the ghosts - michelle
* read in maze configuration files - caleb
* Read in number and behavior of sprites through files? - caleb
* Lives and score - hannah
* Start level progression?
